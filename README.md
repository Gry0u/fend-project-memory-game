# Memory Game Project
This is a matching game where you have to find all the pairs.

## Get started
1. Clone repo or download manually files
2. Load index.html in your browser

## How to play
The game starts (including timer) as soon as you load the page.  
The cards are displayed for 8 seconds. Try to memorize them as best as you can.  
Then you have to click on a first and a second card.  
If your 2 selected cards match, they are left shown. Otherwise they are hidden again.  
Once you have matched all the cards, your final score and the time you needed to complete the game are displayed.  
You can restart the game anytime in clicking on the restart button.
